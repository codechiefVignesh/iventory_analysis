# MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

> There are three versions of the machine learning models used for predictions and are tested in the database to select the precise model for our application.
#### 1) DecisionTreeRegressor
#### 2) DecisionTreeRegressor with Gradient Boost
#### 3) DecisionTreeRegressor with extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost

> We have also used heuristic based approach for prediction as in the Fractional Knapsack based on Greedy Strategy

Model that will be Integrated is the DecisionTreeRegressor with XGBoost
